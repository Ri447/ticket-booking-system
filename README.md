# Ticket Booking System (C)

A command-line ticket booking system implemented in C using dynamic memory allocation and linked data structures.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of:
- Singly linked lists
- Doubly linked lists
- Dynamic memory management
- Menu-driven interface

---

## Features

- Add new events
- Automatically generate seats
- View all events
- Check seat availability
- Book multiple seats
- Prevent double booking
- Memory cleanup on exit

## Data Structures Used

| Structure | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Doubly Linked List | Stores events |
| Singly Linked List | Stores seats of each event |
| Dynamic Allocation | Runtime memory management |

---

## How It Works

Each event contains:
- Event ID
- Event name
- Total seats
- Linked list of seats

Each seat contains:
- Seat number
- Booking status
